# Global Finance on Blockchain

In this code pattern, we will be extending the [global-financing-blockchain](https://developer.ibm.com/patterns/global-financing-use-case-for-blockchain) code pattern by deploying the smart contract on a Hyperledger Fabric Network created on IBM Blockchain Platform instead of a local instance of the Hyperledger Fabric. This use case is inspired by the [RedBook tutorial](https://www.redbooks.ibm.com/Redbooks.nsf/RedbookAbstracts/crse0401.html?Open) by Bob Dill and uses the same application interface. It employs a Node.js smart contract and a Node.js web application.

The Global Finance use case involves various members such as the Buyer, Seller, Provider, Shipper and Finance Company which perform many actions. Some of these actions are:

* Buyer creates the order.
* Seller contacts a provider for the items in the order.
* Provider provides the items in the order.
* Shipper delivers the items in the order.
* Finance company processes payments to the seller.

The number of participants in this use case, as well as the different types of transactions that can be executed show how this is the perfect use case to demonstrate dispute resolution using the smart contracts and distributed ledgers provided by Blockchain. Blockchain also enables faster settlement of such disputes as opposed to the traditional approaches employed for such a use case.

We will start by packaging the Node.js smart contract using the IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VS Code. Next, we will create a Hyperledger Fabric Network on IBM Blockchain Platform where we will install and instantiate the smart contract. Finally, the Node.js web application, which makes use of the Hyperledger Fabric SDK, can be used to interact with the network.

When you have completed this code pattern, you will understand how to:

* Package a blockchain smart contract using the IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VS Code.
* Set up a Hyperledger Fabric network on IBM Blockchain Platform.
* Install and instantiate a smart contract package through IBM Blockchain Platform.
* Test the blockchain network by executing a Node.js application with the Hyperledger Fabric SDK to interact with the deployed network by issuing transactions.

1. The Blockchain Operator clones the GitHub repo to obtain the Global Finance on Blockchain smart contract.
2. The Blockchain Operator uses the IBM Blockchain Platform Extension for VS Code to package the smart contract.
3. The Blockchain Operator sets up and launches the IBM Blockchain Platform service.
4. The IBM Blockchain Platform enables the creation of a Hyperledger Fabric network onto a IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, enabling installation and instantiation of the Global Finance on Blockchain smart contract on the network.
5. The Users (Buyers, Sellers, Providers, Shippers and Finance Companies) use the Node.js application which in turn uses the Fabric SDK to interact with the deployed network on IBM Blockchain Platform and issue transactions.

# Running the application

Follow these steps to set up and run this code pattern. The steps are described in detail below.

## Steps

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Package the smart contract](#2-package-the-smart-contract)
3. [Create IBM Cloud services](#3-create-ibm-cloud-services)
4. [Build a network](#4-build-a-network)
5. [Deploy Global Finance Smart Contract on the network](#5-deploy-global-finance-smart-contract-on-the-network)
6. [Connect application to the network](#6-connect-application-to-the-network)
7. [Run the application](#7-run-the-application)


### 1. Clone the repo

Clone this repository in a folder your choice:

```
git clone https://github.com/IBM/Global-Finance-on-Blockchain.git
```

### 2. Package the smart contract

We will use the IBM Blockchain Platform extension on VS Code to package the smart contract.

* Open Visual Studio code and open the `contract` folder from `Global-Finance-on-Blockchain` repository that was cloned earlier. 
   **It is important that you are opening the `contract` folder and not the entire `Global-Finance-on-Blockchain` directory; otherwise you will see an error that states that it doesn't understand what programming language you are using.**

* Press the `F1` key to see the different VS code options. Choose `IBM Blockchain Platform: Package Open Project`.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/71910509-05036d00-3140-11ea-8b15-7c8aeb403974.png">
</p>

* Click the `IBM Blockchain Platform` extension button on the left. This will show the packaged contracts on top and the blockchain connections on the bottom.

<p align="center">
  <img height="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/72377051-0f43df00-36dd-11ea-8e54-93c1d21f1853.png">
</p>

* Next, right click on the packaged contract (in this case, select globalfinancing@0.0.1) to export it and choose `Export Package`.

* Choose a location on your machine and save the `.cds` file. We will use this packaged smart contract later to deploy on the IBM Blockchain Platform service.

Now, we will start setting up the different services required for configuring our Hyperledger Fabric network on the IBM Cloud and for running our application using this network.

### 3. Create IBM Cloud services

* Create the [IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/kubernetes/catalog/cluster). You can find the service in the `Catalog`. For this code pattern, we can use the `Free` cluster, and give it a name. Note, that the IBM Cloud allows one instance of a free cluster which expires after 30 days. **Note: it could take 20 minutes for the Kubernetes Service setup to complete**.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/71910506-046ad680-3140-11ea-9f4b-8bcb4d2a651b.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Create the [IBM Blockchain Platform](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/blockchain-platform) service on the IBM Cloud. You can find the service in the `Catalog`, and give it a name.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/71910502-046ad680-3140-11ea-9853-3598b9363d91.gif">
</p>
<br>

* After your kubernetes cluster is up and running, you can deploy your IBM Blockchain Platform on the cluster. Again - wait for the Kubernetes service to indicate it was deployed. The IBM Blockchain Platform service walks through few steps and finds your cluster on the IBM Cloud to deploy the service on.

<br>
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/71910501-046ad680-3140-11ea-8440-9d2fef0be426.gif">
</p>
<br>

* Once the Blockchain Platform is deployed on the Kubernetes cluster, you can launch the console to start configuring your blockchain network.


### 4. Build a network

We will build a network as provided by the IBM Blockchain Platform [documentation](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/blockchain/howto?topic=blockchain-ibp-console-build-network#ibp-console-build-network).

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8854447/72450922-25a77480-3789-11ea-9ce3-2319e7e11008.gif">
</p>
<br>


#### Update application connection
  - Copy the connection profile you downloaded into the [fabric folder](web-app/controller/restapi/features/fabric).
  - Update the [config.json](web-app/controller/restapi/features/fabric/config.json) file with:
    - The connection json file name you downloaded.
    - The <b>enroll id</b> and <b>enroll secret</b> for your app admin, which we earlier provided as `app-admin` and `app-adminpw`.
    - The orgMSP ID, which we provided as `Org1MSP`.
    - The caName, which can be found in your connection json file under "organization" -> "Org1MSP" -> certificateAuthorities". This would be like an IP address and a port.
    - The peerName, which can be found in your connection json file under "organization" -> "Org1MSP" -> peers". This would be like an IP address and a port.
    - The ordererName, which can be found in your connection json file under "orderers". This would be like an IP address and a port.
    - Update gateway discovery to `{ enabled: true, asLocalhost: false }` to connect to IBM Blockchain Platform.

```bash
 {
    "channel_name": "mychannel",
    "smart_contract_name": "globalfinancing",
    "connection_file": "mychannel_globalfinancing_profile.json",
    "appAdmin": "app-admin",

#### Enroll the admin and add identity to the wallet:
  
  **Note: This creates public and private key files for the app-admin in the _idwallet folder inside the [fabric folder](web-app/controller/restapi/features/fabric). If a folder named "app-admin" exists in the "_idwallet" folder, then the following command will not enroll the app-admin as it already exists in the wallet. Remove the app-admin folder and then run the following command.**
  
  ```bash
  node enrollAdmin.js
  ```

#### Run the application:

  ```bash
  npm start
  ```
